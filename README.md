## üõ°Ô∏è Recommendations

## 1. Apply Security Controls from NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5

To mitigate the identified vulnerabilities, implement the following relevant controls:

| **Control ID** | **Control Name**                                      | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SI-02**      | Flaw Remediation                                       | Ensure timely identification and remediation of software flaws.             |
| **SI-03**      | Malicious Code Protection                              | Deploy antivirus and anti-malware tools to detect and prevent RCE attacks.  |
| **AC-03**      | Access Enforcement                                     | Restrict access to sensitive system components to prevent unauthorized use. |
| **CM-02**      | Baseline Configuration                                 | Maintain secure baseline configurations for all systems.                    |
| **RA-05**      | Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning                  | Continuously scan and assess systems for vulnerabilities.                   |
| **IR-04**      | Incident Handling                                      | Establish procedures for responding to detected security incidents.         |
| **AU-06**      | Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting                  | Monitor logs for signs of exploitation or abnormal behavior.                |

## 2. Tailor Controls Using NIST SP 800-53B Baselines

Use the **Moderate Baseline** from SP 800-53B for systems handling sensitive but unclassified data. Tailor controls based on:
- System criticality
- Threat environment
- Organizational risk tolerance

## 3. Patch Management and Software Updates
- Apply vendor patches for Microsoft 3D Viewer, Paint 3D, and WinVerifyTrust vulnerabilities.
- Automate patch deployment where feasible to reduce exposure windows.

## 4. Enhance Monitoring and Logging
- Implement continuous monitoring aligned with the RMF Monitor Step.
- Use SIEM tools to detect anomalous behavior and potential exploitation attempts.

## 5. User Awareness and Training
- Educate users on phishing, file handling, and safe software practices.
- Reinforce the importance of not executing untrusted files or macros.
